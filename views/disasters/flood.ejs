        <h2>What is a Flood</h2>
    </div>

    <div class=content>
        <p>Floods are natural disasters that occur when an area becomes submerged
            in water that overwhelms its natural drainage systems. They can be caused
            by various factors, including heavy rainfall, snowmelt, storm surges, or the breaching
            of dams or levees.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Dam Failure</b>
            </li>
            <p>Flooding can result from dam or hydraulic structure failures, often due to human error.</p>
            <li>
                <b>Heavy Rainfall</b>
            </li>
            <p>One of the most common natural causes of floods is heavy rainfall, especially if it occurs
                over a short period of time or in an area with poor drainage.</p>
            <li>
                <b>River Overflow</b>
            </li>
            <p>Rivers can overflow their banks due to heavy rainfall, snowmelt,
                or a combination of both. When the volume of water flowing into a
                river exceeds its capacity, it spills over onto adjacent land.</p>
        </ul>
